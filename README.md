Decentralized Ethereum Transactions - Blockchain Application

I developed a decentralized application that simplifies sending ETH and tracking transaction history on the blockchain. Built with React, the app connects to Ethereum wallets via MetaMask and allows users to make transactions that are permanently archived on the blockchain.

Key features include:

Transaction History: Users can view detailed records of their transactions, including sender and recipient information, messages, Gifs, and timestamps.
Smart Contract Testing: The application enables testing of smart contracts on the Goerli testnet, a secure environment for ETH transactions before deploying on Ethereum's main network.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, the app presents transaction data in an accessible and organized manner.
This project not only enhanced my understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency but also provided a practical solution for managing Ethereum transactions.
